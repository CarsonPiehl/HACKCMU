# SkyNet README

A small project made by Carson Piehl and Ronnie Amaralikit for HACKCMU 2023 that shows satellites moving in real time from current observer position. Not currently maintained or hosted anywhere, and certainly not production grade TypeScript or THREE.js. Uses public satellite TLEs from Celestrak.org, (previously manually fed, since there is an API limit of 2 requests per 24 hours).
